# spaceEscape
A project I did with C++
This is a little game I made using C++. It shows examples of polymorphism, containers, and memory management. To play the game
just download all of the files and compile. I will be doing updates to the code and adding minor features that I was
unable to do originally. Please come back and check out the updates I add.
